- Clean up auth service
- Write tests for the gateway and authentication services
- Put into production (figure out the best way of using GKE on GCP)
- Finish writing initial version of documentation
- Try and making a working kub cluster even just locally on machine with /release configuration
- Could look at adding the Kub dashboard as a pod+service on the release, so we can monitor production systems using a standardised open tool
- add userIDs + clean up schema
